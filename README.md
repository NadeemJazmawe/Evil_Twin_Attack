# Evil_Twin_Attack

An evil twin attack is a #hack_attack in which a hacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi network that looks like a legitimate access point to steal victimsâ€™ sensitive details. Most often, the victims of such attacks are ordinary people like you and me.

The attack can be performed as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The fake Wi-Fi access point is used to eavesdrop on users and steal their login credentials or other sensitive information. Because the hacker owns the equipment being used, the victim will have no idea that the hacker might be intercepting things like bank transactions.

An evil twin access point can also be used in a phishing scam. In this type of attack, victims will connect to the evil twin and will be lured to a phishing site. It will prompt them to enter their sensitive data, such as their login details. These, of course, will be sent straight to the hacker. Once the hacker gets them, they might simply disconnect the victim and show that the server is temporarily unavailable.
